type: integration

brief: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system watches selected files and triggering alerts
       when these files are modified. Specifically, these tests will verify that FIM detects
       the correct 'inotify watches' number when renaming and deleting a monitored directory.
       The FIM capability is managed by the 'guardsarm-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured
       files for changes to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.

        realtime: Enable real-time monitoring on Linux (using the 'inotify' system calls) and Windows systems.
        whodata: Implies real-time monitoring but adding the 'who-data' information.
    - tier:
        0: Only level 0 tests are performed, they check basic functionalities and are quick to perform.
        1: Only level 1 tests are performed, they check functionalities of medium complexity.
        2: Only level 2 tests are performed, they check advanced functionalities and are slow to perform.

    description: Check if the 'guardsarm-syscheckd' daemon detects the correct number of 'inotify watches' when
                 renaming and deleting a monitored directory. For this purpose, the test will create and monitor
                 a folder with two subdirectories. Once FIM is started, it will verify that three watches have
                 been detected. If these 'inotify watches' are correct, the test will make file operations on
                 the monitored folder or do nothing. Finally, it will verify that the 'inotify watches' number
                 detected in the generated FIM events is correct.

        - Verify that FIM adds 'inotify watches' when monitored directories have been removed or renamed, and
          they are restored.

    input_description: A test case (num_watches_conf) is contained in external YAML file (cases_num_watches.yaml)
                       which includes configuration settings for the 'guardsarm-syscheckd' daemon and, these are
